This is an Open Source Project, feel free to add to it!

Description: Extension for Spotify that provides a compact and intuitive on-screen widget for Spotify functionality.
Mission Statement: 
  The purpose of this project is to integrate a simple, low-profile extension for Spotify song navigation. The Spotify Mini Player is designed to provide users with control over their music-listening experience with a simplified and non-intrusive interface.

Initial Language: JavaScript (using Electron)

Proposed UI looks like what chrome already has as a mini player
